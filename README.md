# imacs_ufd_revised
A revision to Ting Li's code for fitting IMACS spectra to get radial velocities and metallicities from the Calcium Triplet.
The revision focuses on (1) controlling input parameters via a config.yaml file, and (2) running two different equivalent width measurements codes.
I have also expanded the RV template grid to include two additional stars (a subgiant and a dwarf/MS star)
